# Unitee-frontend

## Background

This website was my very first solo project since I started learning how to code just a little over 3 months ago. The idea sparked from a conversation I had with a good friend, Bri who has been influential to me taking this big leap of career change. The conversation was random and it was about how we both like pocket tees but there’s not much options out there. She has a couple of side businesses.  So I joked and said "Maybe when I finish school I’ll build her website for a pocket tee business.” So when I was ideating, I remembered that conversation and thought to myself, “I’m not done with school, but I think I can already do it.”
